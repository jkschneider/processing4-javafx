# `FX2D`

This repository contains the JavaFX renderer for Processing 4, also known as `FX2D`. 

The JavaFX binaries have grown very large in size so this was a necessary step to avoid making the Processing download excessively large, given that not everyone uses JavaFX. More discussion/explanation [here](https://github.com/processing/processing4/issues/348).
