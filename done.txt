X   contains too many arbitrary changes (deleted lines, fields made public)
X   uses new image cache object, not clear why
X   cache mechanism would make memory run out
X add the five (now six) platforms to the javafx build
X need internet connection for the build
X   but too complicated to check whether each platform is available
X   and not nearly as onerous a requirement now that it's not part of core

contribs
